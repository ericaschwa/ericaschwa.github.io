		<h2>Erica Schwartz</h2>
		<p>I was born in Buffalo, New York, and lived there until I was five years old. 
			Then, I moved to Hanover, New Hampshire, where I lived for the next 13 years. I 
			have an older sister named Allison, and my parents are Lynn and Gary. Allison
			also went to Tufts- she was in the class of 2014 and majored in International
			Relations. She convinced me of what an incredible place Tufts is, and so I 
			ended up enrolling for the Fall of 2014. I did the preorientation FOCUS, and 
			met some of my best friends there. I also joined Peer Health Exchange, which 
			also turned out to be a fantastic experience, and one that I'm still involved 
			in today. I started out wanting to major in Biopsychology, because I was 
			fascinated with the functioning of the mind, as well as with physical and mental health. This still interests me, but when I took Comp 11 and tried programming for the first time, I knew that I wanted to major in computer science. I took more classes, such as Comp 15 and Comp 40, And now here I am, in COMP 20!
